## Create a note

-first create an object (const book = {})
-now stringify (json.stringify(book))
-next fs.writefilesync ('name of new file', our new stringify file

## Read a file and parse it

-fsreadfilesync(name of new file created above)
-make it a string (toString())
-parse it
-do something with it

everything needs loaded as a constant and moved along the above chain.

const stuff = do something
const another = do something with [stuff]
const last = do something with [another]
...and so on
